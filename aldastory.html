                Hi Everyone! My name is Alda and I am the founder of HEAL. 
                If you found your way to this page, you’re probably at least curious to why I started this. <br> <br>

                I have always been intrigued and moved by the stories of people around me. 
                Being the vice head of my school’s Peer Counsel club during high school, I realized my passion for helping people. 
                Everyone has their own struggles but how we deal with them varies individual to individual. 
                But one thing that I know for sure that most people will say at the end of the counselling session was 
                “I feel so relieved and reassured having someone listen to me without judgement”. 
                This has always opened and touched my heart, and it makes me realise how people want to be heard and understood. <br><br>

                When I entered university, I felt lost and unsure of my future. 
                The pressure of having to decide my future when it was so uncertain gave me a lot of anxiety. 
                It would affect my sleep and I found myself unable to perform well in projects I was taking. 
                Nothing seemed to motivate me, and I just didn't see the joy of doing them or anything else for that matter. 
                Eventually, I lost interest in the activities and hobbies I used to love and turned to cigarettes and alcohol as an escape. <br><br>
                
                I realised then that I had a problem because it was taking over my life. 
                I seemed fine and cheery on the outside, no one could see that on the inside, I was struggling.
                Plus, the depression and anxiety just started to affect me physically, 
                I started having acne and terrible breakouts, worsened by the sleepless nights I had been having.
                So then, I thought I needed to fix this. I need help. <br><br>

                I sought out therapy and proceeded to do tons of research to make sure I would find the most suitable one for me. 
                Long story short, it turned my life around. <br><br>
                
                Wellit helped me figure out how to turn my own life around.
                It gave me a safe space to sort out and accept what I was experiencing without any sort of judgement. 
                You're supposed to talk about them, so there's no feeling fearful of burdening someone else or feeling ashamed of my issues.
                
                <br><br> The only problem was that it was very costly, and it required a lot of time to travel, 
                which would be completely inaccessible to people without the same privileges I had.
                It was then that I thought of my niche, imagine the ability to have counselling anywhere and anytime, 
                wouldn't more people be able to get the help they need? <br> <br>

                So, I decided then and there to pursue a counselling degree to help others in similar situations as I had been. 
                That was when HEAL was born. <br><br>
                
                I envisioned HEAL to be a platform and community a click away on your smartphones 
                where you would not need to feel ashamed of your struggles or needing therapy. 
                You can do it completely online which cuts costs and at your convenience, especially if you are a person with social anxiety. 
                I wanted to create a supportive environment where people can encourage and 
                empower each other together in their journeys to better mental health which leads to of course, better life satisfaction.
