# Project-Heal (A recovery program website)

# HTML and CSS Project 1 

# Motivation

This project requires us to use HTML and CSS for a website. The website is a personalised recovery membership program for those who are abusing drugs, 
smoking and alcohol as well as those facing anxiety and depression. 
It aims to empower and help people through a community and expert counsellors available online, in guiding them towards a better lifestyle. 

The 6 pages include: 
``` 
- Story about the founder 
- A short description on what the program is about
- How the membership works 
- About the team 
- Reviews about the members who had undergone the program
- A login page for existing members (Since javascript hasn’t been taught the login page is a prototype and only for design flow)
```

Site Owner’s goal: Attract target audience to visit the website and pay for the membership 

External User’s goal: The target audience are those who are seeking for external help in changing and improving their lifestyle habits.

# Demo 

The website can be found here: https://aldafawnia.github.io/Project-Heal/index.html

# Strategy 

The purpose of this website is to diversify in a market niche, providing convenience for those seeking counsellors available at the odd time of day. 
Providing a reasonable price, allowing people to subscribe to our membership instead of having to pay a hefty amount for a coach and counsellor 
which are available in a limited time slot. 

The main competitors for the company are Modern Recovery and Tempest. 
These websites and companies have similar foundations and goals with counselling available online. 
However, Heal differs in terms of services and the personalisation offered for the users. 

## Target Audience (External User's) Objective

Amid the ongoing pandemic it has triggered a rise in mental health crisis. According to CDC from a survey of 5,412 people, 
“roughly 25% of young-adults (age 18-24) considered suicide because of the pandemic. With about 30.9% respondents had symptoms of anxiety or depression 
and over 13% have used alcohol, prescription and/or illegal drugs to deal with their pandemic-induced stress and anxiety.” (Kelly, 2020) 
The data shown is triple the number last year with 11% of adults had seriously considered suicide. 

Therefore, the target audience are the general audience, who are distressed and desperate to get a grip of themselves. 
They are ones who want to make a change in their unhealthy addiction, fix their defense mechanism as well as those who are 
trying to survive each day without the thought of suicide. 

Aim: 
```
- Find as much information about the program, how it will help them 
- Find out the price of the membership
- Find out whether if the program is suitable for them before signing up 
- To read the reviews of existing members 
- Read more about HEAL how it works and how its found
```

## Site Owner Objective 
To provide an inclusive community for people and a readily accessible 24/7 counsellors for those in need. 
To help make a difference in people’s lives and provide a safe space for them through the strong community and team support. 
Helping those who are distressed and desperate to get a grip of themselves to discover their life’s goal and purpose by guiding them. 

Aim: 
```
- Be readily accessible regardless of types of devices used 
- Allow audience to get a glimpse of how the program works
- An interactive design and story-telling approach (light pastel, neutral colours and design are used to make audience feel secure and a warm welcome) 
- Allow people to sign up for the membership 
```

Through the use of a site and data technology, it allows a more personalised care for the people. 
Counsellors and coaches will be able to track the progress of individuals and cater to their needs.

# Surface 

## Colour

Based on research, light yellow, gold-brown and pastel colours have been used.  

This is because yellow is a colour of positivity which offers hope and happiness. However in order for the users to not feel too overwhelmed by the bright energy, toning it down to pastel colour of yellow has been done to give off more of a warmth, secure atmosphere. 

The use of in between gold-brown colours are becaure gold has similar attributes to the colour yellow and brown. Hence in order to illuminate love, compassion, wholesomeness and reliability; the use of gold-brown has been chosen. As brown is said to affect the mind and body as it creates cozy feelings of stability, peace and relaxation.

## Fonts 

Serif font have been used for the logo of HEAL. While Sans Serif font have been used for all the content in the website. 

The logo uses serif as it gives off to users a sense of trustworthy image and creates a sense of formality and credibility. There is an elegance and confidence to it, allowing the logo or the brand to appear more established, reputable and serious. This is because serif fonts are mostly used in traditional mediums like books and newspapers which is why its normally seen as more classic and refined. By using it in logos, it gives off the feeling that Heal is an educated company alluding to people that they are experienced and knowledgeable.

Meanwhile, sans serif is used in context as it conveys approachability and clean. It is modern and embraces simplicity. As the website aim is to provide a modern recovery digital experience for users, this font is suitable for the context as it is more appropriate for on-screen use. It seems casual, informal and friendly in order to appear more relatable for the users. The use of sans serif helps not to intimidate users.

## Images 

Images selected have been based on aesthetic and warm colours. The pictures chosen on the top pages are mostly selected based on visual suitability and atmosphere that each page wants to bring to the users for them to connect and feel the images. 

Picture of sunset waves on the mainpage aims to bring tranquility and soothing quality. The image on membership section shows a girl riding a bicycle around grass-fields, aiming to give off a sense of freedom, happiness and relaxed. The team section shows collage of gatherings pictures of the members having fun together, this is to allude how dedicated the Heal community is in empowering each other. 

# Features

It contains 6 pages: mainpage, about us - the founder’s story and about the team, why Heal - information on how it works, membership - details about the package subscription provided for users and login page. The main page contains sections where users are able to know just enough information on what the company is about with testimonials, data statistics and videos. Each section in the main page has a call to action button for them to link easily with the other pages, not only relying on navbar. The login page is still for visual purposes as javascript has not been taught hence the site owner will come back to update this website once learned. 

## Responsiveness 

The website is responsive across all devices, it’s user-friendly. There's a navigation bar allowing users to navigate on both header and footer of the site. The navigation bar will collapse into a dropdown option when the screen size is on smaller devices like mobile. It will have a hamburger icon on the top right corner of the navigation bar. The footer navigation bar allows the users to view all the other page links. Allowing users to easily click on the other page without having to scroll up again. 

## Consistency 

The header, footer stay consistent throughout the sit. Except for the login page, footer is not placed there as the section is only 1 page and navbar is readily available on the top. The atmosphere, theme and mood of the website also stays consistent with a similar colour palette that flows and matches well. It allows users to feel in depth the content through the consistent atmosphere each page tries to give.
