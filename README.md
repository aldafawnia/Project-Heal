# Project-Heal (A recovery program website)

# HTML and CSS Project 1 

# Motivation

This project requires us to use HTML and CSS for a website. The website is a personalised recovery membership program for those who are abusing drugs, 
smoking and alcohol as well as those facing anxiety and depression. 
It aims to empower and help people through a community and expert counsellors available online, in guiding them towards a better lifestyle. 

The 6 pages include: 
``` 
- Story about the founder 
- A short description on what the program is about
- How the membership works 
- About the team 
- Reviews about the members who had undergone the program
- A login page for existing members (Since javascript hasn’t been taught the login page is a prototype and only for design flow)
```

Site Owner’s goal: Attract target audience to visit the website and pay for the membership 

External User’s goal: The target audience are those who are seeking for external help in changing and improving their lifestyle habits.

# Strategy 

The purpose of this website is to diversify in a market niche, providing convenience for those seeking counsellors available at the odd time of day. 
Providing a reasonable price, allowing people to subscribe to our membership instead of having to pay a hefty amount for a coach and counsellor 
which are available in a limited time slot. 

The main competitors for the company are Modern Recovery and Tempest. 
These websites and companies have similar foundations and goals with counselling available online. 
However, Heal differs in terms of services and the personalisation offered for the users. 

## Target Audience (External User's) Objective

Amid the ongoing pandemic it has triggered a rise in mental health crisis. According to CDC from a survey of 5,412 people, 
“roughly 25% of young-adults (age 18-24) considered suicide because of the pandemic. With about 30.9% respondents had symptoms of anxiety or depression 
and over 13% have used alcohol, prescription and/or illegal drugs to deal with their pandemic-induced stress and anxiety.” (Kelly, 2020) 
The data shown is triple the number last year with 11% of adults had seriously considered suicide. 

Therefore, the target audience are the general audience, who are distressed and desperate to get a grip of themselves. 
They are ones who want to make a change in their unhealthy addiction, fix their defense mechanism as well as those who are 
trying to survive each day without the thought of suicide. 

Aim: 
```
- Find as much information about the program, how it will help them 
- Find out the price of the membership
- Find out whether if the program is suitable for them before signing up 
- To read the reviews of existing members 
- Read more about HEAL how it works and how its found
```

## Site Owner Objective 
To provide an inclusive community for people and a readily accessible 24/7 counsellors for those in need. 
To help make a difference in people’s lives and provide a safe space for them through the strong community and team support. 
Helping those who are distressed and desperate to get a grip of themselves to discover their life’s goal and purpose by guiding them. 

Aim: 
```
- Be readily accessible regardless of types of devices used 
- Allow audience to get a glimpse of how the program works
- An interactive design and story-telling approach (light pastel, neutral colours and design are used to make audience feel secure and a warm welcome) 
- Allow people to sign up for the membership 
```

Through the use of a site and data technology, it allows a more personalised care for the people. 
Counsellors and coaches will be able to track the progress of individuals and cater to their needs.
